<div>
    <a href="index.html"></a>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="home.html></a></li>

        <li><a href="cakes.html></a></li>
    </ul>
</div>

In this case, div>a will only apply the styling to the 'a' tag which is the direct descendant of the div element and not to the 'a' tags enclosed within 
the unordered list (ul) tag.

(a) Collaboration - It allows multiple team members to work on the same file without any conflict. Any changes thus made can be merged at a later stage.
(b) Multiple Versions - It saves multiple versions of files during project development. Thus, it keeps track of changes which were made between each version.
(c) Restoring Work - If we mess up our work then we can easily identify a point to which we would like to go back and start again. 
(d) Backup - It serves as a backup thus if anything were to happen to the project files stored on the remote repository, we can easily recover the work from 
copies stored on members' local repositories.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow. 
Ans. The steps in Lambda's git flow are as below:
(a) Fork the repository so that it now shows up a repository under my GitHub profile. 
(b) Click on the green button which says 'Code' then dropdown to select the link for cloning a copy of the repository on my device. 
(c) cd into the folder where the repository needs to be cloned and type the command 'git clone' + copied link on the command line. 
(d) Once successfully cloned, cd into the repository. 
(e) We can start making changes to the repository either by adding, modifying or deleting files. 
(f) After each significant change, we would type 'git add .' which would add any changes made in the current directory before they can be committed. 
(g) After adding the changes, we need to commit those changes by typing 'git commit -m "meaningful message" ' which will help explain what the change is.
(h) After committing the changes we can push those changes to the remote repository stored on github where these changes will be incorporated. 
(i) We need to make periodic 'git add' , 'git commit' and 'git push' to the remote repository as changes are made to the project files. 
(j) Once we finish working on these files, we need to select the branch-name instead of master from the dropdown and click new pull request to create a pull request. 
(k) After the pull request page opens up, we need to select our name from the dropdown instead of the forked repository. 
(l) After making this selection from the dropdown, we can add reviewers, if there are any, and finish creating the pull request. 

The above description encompasses all steps involved in Lambda's git flow according to my understanding and experience so far.
